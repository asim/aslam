The world forgot why we're here. We've gotten lost in our 
own desires and goals. In the entertainment value of the next
swipe and dopamine hit from ordering that next Uber Eats. We 
as humans are here for a reason. The [Quran](https://quran.com) 
was sent as a reminder to the whole world. It was sent to remind 
us that we're here to worship God. We're here to do what he 
commanded and we were engineered for. A lot of humanity has lost 
that understanding or not even begun to understand. While the Quran 
is 1400 years old, technology has only reached a place now that we 
can access it in any language instantly. Yet there still seems 
to be something holding us back from fully embracing it. The Quran
was given to an Arab nation in the Arabic language and with that so
much still projects the idea that its only for those of Arab 
descent. This is not the case. The Quran is for everyone. Islam 
is for everyone.

[Reminder](https://reminder.dev) is a new project I'm working on
to improve the accessibility to the Quran and related works in a
modern world. A technology driven world. This means primarily focus
on a developer audience to start. Making it programmatically accessible 
and also querable via an LLM (large language model). So far I'm working 
with the English translation of the Quran, Hadiths and names of God. 
Building an index with embeddings generated via OpenAI's API we can 
now query the Quran and Hadiths in real time with natural language 
questions and get accurate responses using GPT 4o mini. This is a 
very powerful tool that should open the doors of Islam and a path 
to Allah for those who have struggled or are intimidated by the 
other means of asking the questions.

What is my personal motivation here? I myself have questions and while 
I continue to read the Quran and Sunnah on a daily basis, its enormous 
amount of text to ingest and reason about. So being able to ask the 
questions to an LLM is a way of getting to the source or specific 
texts I'm interested at that. I also feel like its my duty as a muslim 
now to help others find the path to Allah the way I did. One straight 
read of the Quran in English can be life changing, but after that 
we all have questions. While one can seek out the help or look internally
we should also leverages the tools we have to improve this experience.

God willing this is something that will be beneficial for everyone.
