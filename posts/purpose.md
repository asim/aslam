All that is created within the universe is not without a purpose including the universe itself. As human beings we should get to know 
this purpose and reflect on how we can fulfill ours. Whether it's the oceans, the earth, the trees, the leaves, the birds, the skies 
or whatever else exists, it's all engineered to do something and operate harmoniously within it's ecosystem. If you point to anything,
you should be able to reflect on what it does and why. 

We as human beings have lost that sense of purpose. 

Consumerism and the advent of technology has made us lazy. Each one of us used to serve a greater purpose, we were fulfilled by our roles 
in society, or at home. Our role primarily to serve the command of our creator, as we were not devoid of being engineered, manufactured, 
built, to do something. It is ingrained deeply in our DNA, not just to consume mindless content streamed to us over the internet and 
television, or the countless packaged goods or coffees from starbucks or your local food store. No. We are here for a reason. We have 
a purpose. Each one of us has been given skills and abilities, and we need to make full use of that. And that should be deeply reflected 
in the work we do, the services we offer and tools we manufacture.

Today if we were to name the top 3 apps they are Instagram, Facebook and TikTok. Tools which we should firstly define as social media as 
opposed to social networking. With a 1:N broadcast and consumption bias. Tools that no longer serve us but that we serve through clicks 
and scrolls leading to more advertising dollars in the pockets of large corporations. The tools which have now become a form of usury, a 
place for vanity and leading to significant numbers in depressed individuals who long for a life they don't lead. Is this the way we want 
technology to continue on in the years to come?

Every tool or service we make should serve a positive function in society. And where we see flaws in the design or ill use of it, we fight
to rectify it.

In the modern age we leveraged technology to entertain ourselves with no bounds. And in the birth of AI we have already begun to see what 
generative artificial intelligence has done to make this an infinite loop that many will struggle to escape. What do you do when the AI 
will create anything you desire? Without guardrails, without checks and balances, without some moral code of ethics, humanity is bound 
to lose itself in a system of false happiness and contentment.

Everything we make should have a meaningful purpose.
