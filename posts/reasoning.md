I've written a couple posts here using AI and what I
found very quickly is a loss of the sense of accomplishment. 
While AI can very rapidly get to a similar place as what 
might take me a couple hours, what I lose out on is far more 
profound. People say AI is going to improve so many fields in 
so many ways but I think one place where we're going to fall 
short is our feeling of accomplishment and deeper understanding of how we got yhere when performing hard tasks. 
Ofcourse they say this means we'll move on to new forms of work
that will give us an even greater form of meaning but 
I'd be remiss if I didnt say that I feel slightly cheated by the 
ease of whats outputted. You see if I'm writing a piece of content
so much of that process isn't the output itself but the time I 
spent reasoning and thinking about. If what we're replacing is 
our rationale mind and process of reflection then we are losing 
so much of what it means to be human. Perhaps that time spent 
could be put to better use elsewhere but I'd say we are very 
rapidly going to lose the ability to reason at all and that's 
scary.

If I look at the history of abstractions or building blocks in science, nature and 
computing then its only fair to say this is evolution and eventually we'll abstract
away the hard work for many human heavy labour tasks of today. And so much of that 
heavy labour is not physical but mental. 
Knowledge work is to be replaced. Which 
means reasoning about what we onced reason 
about is going to disappear. This should 
concern us to some degree. While it has a
way of democratising many fields it will 
also means we need to be more cognisant 
of that which is an entirely human experience which we're going to hand over
to the machines.
