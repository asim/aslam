MVP stands for minimal viable product. The basic gist is defining the smallest scope in which a product can be delivered 
to test it's viability to an external audience. Often times this starts either as something small and then develops
feature creep or becomes an endless list of tasks with no possibility of ever seeing the light of day. When it comes 
to the MVP, we have to be careful and consider, what's really needed to test a thesis.

The best way to figure this out is to really walk through an example. Joe Blogs is starting a new venture. He wants to 
start a blog and a mailing list so he can educate people on his area of expertise, home DIY. He's recruited his best 
friend, who happens to be a software engineer to help him out. Joe's friend starts listing off the variety of tools he's 
going to need to signup to and setup before getting started, as well as the need for a domain, email and web hosting. 
Not only that, Joe's engineering friend has decided self hosting a lot of this will be best route forward since he 
knows how to do all that. 


Joe's starting to feel a bit overwhelmed. What's this going to cost? How's he going to maintain any of it? He doesn't 
know the first thing about web administration let alone email hosting or domain management. Joe's friend is insistent 
though, so he let's him get on with it. A few weeks go by and Joe's no closer to launching his new venture. Apparently 
there was a need to build a subscription mailing list from scratch because there was no viable alternative and all the 
web hosting software had "terrible editors" so he chose something called github pages and jekyll instead. 

Technology choices aside, Joe just wants to share his knowledge with those who care. He's decided to take matters into his own 
hands; he google's "starting a blog" and ends up finding a short tutorial on Wordpress which helps setup a blog 
and includes some sort mailing list plugin. This is great, within a couple hour's Joe is already passionately cracking 
away at some DIY content for people. He sends to a few friends and get's the ball rolling.

As engineers we often have a tendency to overthink a solution from a technology perspective and forget the premise of 
what we're actually using it for. The technology itself is nice to play with but if it doesn't 
serve a greater purpose, it's nothing more than a creative hobby like building sandcastles.

The real MVP isn't the minimum tech stack needed to complete 100% of business requirements or cost savings from self hosting 
everything. It's determining the viability of a product or project by shipping something as quick as possible to those who'll 
benefit from it in the here and now.

When we as engineers are inlisted in helping get a project off the ground we have to take into account the audience who 
then has to make use of the tools we facilitate for them and what they're going to do next if things work. Sometimes that 
means leaving behind our creative itch and doing what's most pragmatic, like recommending Wordpress instead of a host of other tools 
we might personally prefer to use.
