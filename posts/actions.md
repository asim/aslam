In a famous [Hadith](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1) we are told, actions are judged by their intention. Ultimately the why matters more 
than the what. Why did you do something? What was the reasoning and rationale behind it? Did you intend something good or bad? We have 
one life, in which we are tested, and each moment is part of a sequence of events that are steered by the conscious or inconscious 
decisions that we take. Effectively in any given moment we must expend energy to inact whatever we desire. Will it be for good or evil? 
Given the time constraints and that of energy, how will we make the most of our time and energy?

Most people do not think about the good or bad, they act. A moral system of governance and code of law has been instilled on them by 
the people and society. By their parents, teachers and all those around them. People are unconsciously moving throughout their lives 
either doing good or no harm at all. So what of those actions? How will they be judged? Essentially a good deed should be one inspired 
by the desire to please one's maker, Allah (SWT).

We were created to worship Allah alone and in that our actions should have the intention of pleasing him and doing what he wills. Walking 
through life unmindful of our actions is a way to slowly lose ourselves. To slowly, step by step, distance ourselves from our true purpose 
and our Lord. In all that we do, we should remember why we are doing it, why do we put food in our bodies, why do we sleep at night, why 
do we educate ourselves, why do we work, what is it's purpose. And ultimately, the greatest question, why are we here. When we begin to 
question these things and develop a real understand it becomes clear that we need to be mindful of every action, even the smallest of 
actions like the "rubbish" we throw away. Where is that going? Am I benefitting the world and the ecosystem by throwing that away? Or 
am I contributing to some larger problem.

Let us develop a mindfulness that betters our actions and sets our intentions to come closer to Allah, the most exalted and most praiseworthy.
