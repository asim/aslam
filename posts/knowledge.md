This post was written using the [Reminder](https://github.com/asim/reminder). The Quran and Hadiths are used as context for any question posed to the LLM. The index provides the sources that match the question 
and then feed that into the LLM as context. The output was a post on "The Search for Knowledge". The text and references are included below.

### *Write a piece of text titled “The search for knowledge” which contains 3-4 paragraphs on how the world sought out knowledge, what it does now and where it is going in the future. Make reference to the reminder in the end stating it as the ultimate goal of our existence.*

### The Search for Knowledge

Throughout history, the pursuit of knowledge has been a fundamental aspect of human existence. From the ancient civilizations that adorned their walls with hieroglyphs to the philosophers of Greece who questioned the nature of reality, humanity has always sought to understand the world around them. This quest has led to significant advancements in various fields, including science, medicine, literature, and art. Each discovery and every piece of knowledge built upon the foundation laid by previous generations, showcasing an unending desire to learn and grow.

In modern times, the search for knowledge has transformed dramatically with the advent of technology. The internet has democratized access to information, allowing people from all walks of life to share ideas, conduct research, and educate themselves. Educational institutions and online platforms have proliferated, catering to a diverse audience eager to expand their horizons. However, this abundance of knowledge also poses challenges, as discernment becomes crucial in navigating the vast seas of information, distinguishing truth from misinformation.

Looking to the future, the pursuit of knowledge is likely to evolve even further. Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and biotechnology promise exciting possibilities, but they also demand ethical considerations and responsible usage. As the world becomes more interconnected, collaborative learning may reshape how knowledge is shared and developed. Traditional boundaries of disciplines may blur, leading to innovative solutions to the complex problems we face as a society, such as climate change and global health crises.

Ultimately, the search for knowledge serves a higher purpose; it is a reminder of our existence and our responsibilities therein. It encourages us to question, explore, and reflect upon the nature of our lives and the universe. This pursuit is not just about acquiring facts but is intrinsic to understanding our place in the world and fostering compassion for one another. It is this quest for understanding that binds humanity together—a collective journey toward enlightenment and fulfillment.

We were in ignorance and in evil and Allah has bestowed upon us the present good; will there by any evil after this good?” He said, “Yes.” I asked, “Will there be good after that evil?” He said, “Yes, but it would be tained with Dakhan (i.e. Little evil).” I asked, “What will its Dakhan be?” He said, “There will be some people who will lead (people) according to principles other than my tradition. You will see their actions and disapprove of them.” I said, “Will there by any evil after that good?” He said, “Yes, there will be some people who will invite others to the doors of Hell, and whoever accepts their invitation to it will be thrown in it (by them).” I said, “O Allah’s Apostle! Describe those people to us.” He said, “They will belong to us and speak our language” I asked, “What do you order me to do if such a thing should take place in my life?” He said, “Adhere to the group of Muslims and their Chief.” I asked, “If there is neither a group (of Muslims) nor a chief (what shall I do)?” He said, “Keep away from all those different sects, even if you had to bite (i.e. eat) the root of a tree, till you meet Allah while you are still in that state.”

While a man was delivering a speech in the tribe of Kinda, he said, “Smoke will prevail on the Day of Resurrection and will deprive the hypocrites their faculties of hearing and seeing. The believers will be afflicted with something like cold only thereof.” That news scared us, so I went to (Abdullah) Ibn Mas’ud while he was reclining (and told him the story) whereupon he became angry, sat up and said, “He who knows a thing can say, it, but if he does not know, he should say, ‘Allah knows best,’ for it is an aspect of knowledge to say, ‘I do not know,’ if you do not know a certain thing. Allah said to His prophet. ‘Say (O Muhammad): No wage do I ask of you for this (Qur’an), nor I am one of the pretenders (a person who pretends things which do not exist.)’ (38.86)

Quran - The Table Spread 5:48
We have revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ this Book with the truth, as a confirmation of previous Scriptures and a supreme authority on them. So judge between them by what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their desires over the truth that has come to you. To each of you We have ordained a code of law and a way of life. If Allah had willed, He would have made you one community, but His Will is to test you with what He has given ˹each of˺ you. So compete with one another in doing good. To Allah you will all return, then He will inform you ˹of the truth˺ regarding your differences.

Shall we depend on this (and leave work)?” He replied. “Carry on doing (good deeds), for everybody will find easy (to do) such deeds as will lead him to his destined place.” The Prophet then recited:

I heard the Prophet saying, “Allah will not deprive you of knowledge after he has given it to you, but it will be taken away through the death of the religious learned men with their knowledge. Then there will remain ignorant people who, when consulted, will give verdicts according to their opinions whereby they will mislead others and go astray.”

Hadith - Volume 8, Book 75, Number 399 : Narrated by Sa’d bin Abi Waqqas

While I was in the city of the Prophet, a man came and complained to him (the Prophet, ) of destitution and poverty. Then another man came and complained of robbery (by highwaymen). The Prophet said, “Adi! Have you been to Al-Hira?” I said, “I haven’t been to it, but I was informed about it.” He said, “If you should live for a long time, you will certainly see that a lady in a Howdah traveling from Al-Hira will (safely reach Mecca and) perform the Tawaf of the Ka’ba, fearing none but Allah.” I said to myself, “What will happen to the robbers of the tribe of Tai who have spread evil through out the country?” The Prophet further said. “If you should live long, the treasures of Khosrau will be opened (and taken as spoils).” I asked, “You mean Khosrau, son of Hurmuz?” He said, “Khosrau, son of Hurmuz; and if you should live long, you will see that one will carry a handful of gold or silver and go out looking for a person to accept it from him, but will find none to accept it from him. And any of you, when meeting Allah, will meet Him without needing an interpreter between him and Allah to interpret for him, and Allah will say to him: ‘Didn’t I send a messenger to teach you?’ He will say: ‘Yes.’ Allah will say: ‘Didn’t I give you wealth and do you favors?’ He will say: ‘Yes.’ Then he will look to his right and see nothing but Hell, and look to his left and see nothing but Hell.”

Hadith - Volume 4, Book 52, Number 209 : Narrated by Abdullah
Today a man came to me and asked me a question which I did not know how to answer. He said, “Tell me, if a wealthy active man, well-equipped with arms, goes out on military expeditions with our chiefs, and orders us to do such things as we cannot do (should we obey him?)” I replied, “By Allah, I do not know what to reply you, except that we, were in the company of the Prophet and he used to order us to do a thing once only till we finished it. And no doubt, everyone among you will remain in a good state as long as he obeys Allah. If one is in doubt as to the legality of something, he should ask somebody who would satisfy him, but soon will come a time when you will not find such a man. By Him, except Whom none has the right to be worshipped. I see that the example of what has passed of this life (to what remains thereof) is like a pond whose fresh water has been used up and nothing remains but muddy water.”

Name - The Last
The Last - Al Aakhir - The Last: Is the One who exists without interruption while the creatures are annihilated at every moment; He who is eternal, He who annihilates and is exempt from being annihilated and the disappearance of one or more attributes; The one that exists without being concerned by the notion of end and annihilation

The last Verse that was revealed was:

Quran - The Iron 57:20
Know that this worldly life is no more than play, amusement, luxury, mutual boasting, and competition in wealth and children. This is like rain that causes plants to grow, to the delight of the planters. But later the plants dry up and you see them wither, then they are reduced to chaff. And in the Hereafter there will be either severe punishment or forgiveness and pleasure of Allah, whereas the life of this world is no more than the delusion of enjoyment.

Hadith - Volume 6, Book 60, Number 151 : Narrated by Abdullah
Allah’s Apostle said, “The key of the Unseen are five: Verily with Allah (Alone) is the knowledge of the Hour He sends down the rain and knows what is in the wombs. No soul knows what it will earn tomorrow, and no soul knows in what land it will die. Verily, Allah is All-Knower, All-Aware.” (31.34)

Quran - The Nightcommer 86:5
Let people then consider what they were created from!

Quran - Jonah 10:24
The life of this world is just like rain We send down from the sky, producing a mixture of plants which humans and animals consume. Then just as the earth looks its best, perfectly beautified, and its people think they have full control over it, there comes to it Our command by night or by day, so We mow it down as if it never flourished yesterday! This is how We make the signs clear for people who reflect.

Hadith - Volume 8, Book 76, Number 435 : Narrated by Abu Sa’id Al-Khudri
Allah’s Apostle said, “The thing I am afraid of most for your sake, is the worldly blessings which Allah will bring forth to you.” It was said, “What are the blessings of this world?” The Prophet said, “The pleasures of the world.” A man said, “Can the good bring forth evil?” The Prophet kept quiet for a while till we thought that he was being inspired divinely. Then he started removing the sweat from his forehead and said,” Where is the questioner?” That man said, “I (am present).” Abu Sa’id added: We thanked the man when the result (of his question) was such. The Prophet said, “Good never brings forth but good. This wealth (of the world) is (like) green and sweet (fruit), and all the vegetation which grows on the bank of a stream either kills or nearly kills the animal that eats too much of it, except the animal that eats the Khadira (a kind of vegetation). Such an animal eats till its stomach is full and then it faces the sun and starts ruminating and then it passes out dung and urine and goes to eat again. This worldly wealth is (like) sweet (fruit), and if a person earns it (the wealth) in a legal way and spends it properly, then it is an excellent helper, and whoever earns it in an illegal way, he will be like the one who eats but is never satisfied.”

Allah’s Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, “Keys of the unseen knowledge are five which nobody knows but Allah … nobody knows what will happen tomorrow; nobody knows what is in the womb; nobody knows what he will gain tomorrow; nobody knows at what place he will die; and nobody knows when it will rain.”

Quran - The Cleaving 82:17
What will make you realize what Judgment Day is?

Hadith - Volume 4, Book 52, Number 95 : Narrated by Abu Said Al-Khudri
Allah’s Apostle ascended the pulpit and said, “Nothing worries me as to what will happen to you after me, except the temptation of worldly blessings which will be conferred on you.” Then he mentioned the worldly pleasures. He started with the one (i.e. the blessings) and took up the other (i.e. the pleasures). A man got up saying, “O Allah’s Apostle! Can the good bring about evil?” The Prophet remained silent and we thought that he was being inspired divinely, so all the people kept silent with awe. Then the Prophet wiped the sweat off his face and asked, “Where is the present questioner?” “Do you think wealth is good?” he repeated thrice, adding, “No doubt, good produces nothing but good. Indeed it is like what grows on the banks of a stream which either kills or nearly kills the grazing animals because of gluttony except the vegetation-eating animal which eats till both its flanks are full (i.e. till it gets satisfied) and then stands in the sun and defecates and urinates and again starts grazing. This worldly property is sweet vegetation. How excellent the wealth of the Muslim is, if it is collected through legal means and is spent in Allah’s Cause and on orphans, poor people and travelers. But he who does not take it legally is like an eater who is never satisfied and his wealth will be a witness against him on the Day of Resurrection.”

The Verse:

Hadith - Volume 9, Book 88, Number 206 : Narrated by Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman
The people used to ask Allah’s Apostle about the good but I used to ask him about the evil lest I should be overtaken by them. So I said, “O Allah’s Apostle! We were living in ignorance and in an (extremely) worst atmosphere, then Allah brought to us this good (i.e., Islam); will there be any evil after this good?” He said, “Yes.” I said, ‘Will there be any good after that evil?” He replied, “Yes, but it will be tainted (not pure.)” I asked, “What will be its taint?” He replied, “(There will be) some people who will guide others not according to my tradition? You will approve of some of their deeds and disapprove of some others.” I asked, “Will there be any evil after that good?” He replied, “Yes, (there will be) some people calling at the gates of the (Hell) Fire, and whoever will respond to their call, will be thrown by them into the (Hell) Fire.” I said, “O Allah s Apostle! Will you describe them to us?” He said, “They will be from our own people and will speak our language.” I said, “What do you order me to do if such a state should take place in my life?” He said, “Stick to the group of Muslims and their Imam (ruler).” I said, “If there is neither a group of Muslims nor an Imam (ruler)?” He said, “Then turn away from all those sects even if you were to bite (eat) the roots of a tree till death overtakes you while you are in that state.”

Allah’s Apostle said, “Allah said, “I have prepared for My Pious slaves things which have never been seen by an eye, or heard by an ear, or imagined by a human being.” If you wish, you can recite this Verse from the Holy Quran:–“No soul knows what is kept hidden for them, of joy as a reward for what they used to do.” (32.17)

Hadith - Volume 2, Book 23, Number 468 : Narrated by Samura bin Jundab
The man went to pick it up and by the time he returned to him, the crushed head had returned to its normal state and the man came back and struck him again (and so on). I said, ‘Who is this?’ They told me to proceed on; so we proceeded on and passed by a hole like an oven; with a narrow top and wide bottom, and the fire was kindling underneath that hole. Whenever the fire-flame went up, the people were lifted up to such an extent that they about to get out of it, and whenever the fire got quieter, the people went down into it, and there were naked men and women in it. I said, ‘Who is this?’ They told me to proceed on. So we proceeded on till we reached a river of blood and a man was in it, and another man was standing at its bank with stones in front of him, facing the man standing in the river. Whenever the man in the river wanted to come out, the other one threw a stone in his mouth and caused him to retreat to his original position; and so whenever he wanted to come out the other would throw a stone in his mouth, and he would retreat to his original position. I asked, ‘What is this?’ They told me to proceed on and we did so till we reached a well-flourished green garden having a huge tree and near its root was sitting an old man with some children. (I saw) Another man near the tree with fire in front of him and he was kindling it up. Then they (i.e. my two companions) made me climb up the tree and made me enter a house, better than which I have ever seen. In it were some old men and young men, women and children.

Quran - The Bee 16:40
If We ever will something ˹to exist˺, all We say is: “Be!” And it is!

Hadith - Volume 6, Book 60, Number 251 : Narrated by Said bin Jubair
The narrator added: Moses did not suffer from fatigue except after he had passed the place he had been ordered to observe. His attendant Yusha bin Nun said to him, ‘Do you remember (what happened) when we betook ourselves to the rock? I did indeed forget (about) the fish …’ (18.63) The narrator added: So they came back, retracing their steps and then they found in the sea, the way of the fish looking like a tunnel. So there was an astonishing event for his attendant, and there was tunnel for the fish. When they reached the rock, they found a man covered with a garment. Moses greeted him. The man said astonishingly, ‘Is there any such greeting in your land?’ Moses said, ‘I am Moses.’ The man said, ‘Moses of Bani Israel?’ Moses said, ‘Yes,’ and added, ‘may I follow you so that you teach me something of the Knowledge which you have been taught?’ (18.66). Al-Khadir said to him, ‘O Moses! You have something of Allah’s knowledge which Allah has taught you and which I do not know; and I have something of Allah’s knowledge which Allah has taught me and which you do not know.’ Moses said, ‘But I will follow you.’ Al-Khadir said, ‘Then if you follow me, ask me no question about anything until I myself speak to you concerning it.’ (18.70). After that both of them proceeded along the seashore. There passed by them a boat whose crew recognized Al-Khadir and received them on board free of charge. So they both got on board. A sparrow came and sat on the edge of the boat and dipped its beak unto the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses. ‘My knowledge and your knowledge and all the creation’s knowledge compared to Allah’s knowledge is not more than the water taken by this sparrow’s beak.’

(the wife of the Prophet) The commencement (of the Divine Inspiration) to Allah’s Apostle was in the form of true dreams in his sleep, for he never had a dream but it turned out to be true and clear as the bright daylight. Then he began to like seclusions, so he used to go in seclusion in the cave of Hira where he used to worship Allah continuously for many nights before going back to his family to take the necessary provision (of food) for the stay. He come back to (his wife) Khadija again to take his provision (of food) likewise, till one day he received the Guidance while he was in the cave of Hira. An Angel came to him and asked him to read. Allah’s Apostle replied, “I do not know how to read.” The Prophet added, “Then the Angel held me (forcibly) and pressed me so hard that I felt distressed. Then he released me and again asked me to read, and I replied, ‘I do not know how to read.’ Thereupon he held me again and pressed me for the second time till I felt distressed. He then released me and asked me to read, but again I replied. ‘I do not know how to read.’ Thereupon he held me for the third time and pressed me till I got distressed, and then he released me and said, ‘Read, in the Name of your Lord Who has created (all that exists), has created man out of a clot, Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous. Who has taught (the writing) by the pen, has taught man that which he knew not.” (96.1-5).

Hadith - Volume 6, Book 61, Number 509 : Narrated by Zaid bin Thabit
Abu Bakr As-Siddiq sent for me when the people! of Yamama had been killed (i.e., a number of the Prophet’s Companions who fought against Musailama). (I went to him) and found ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab sitting with him. Abu Bakr then said (to me), “Umar has come to me and said: “Casualties were heavy among the Qurra’ of the! Qur’an (i.e. those who knew the Quran by heart) on the day of the Battle of Yalmama, and I am afraid that more heavy casualties may take place among the Qurra’ on other battlefields, whereby a large part of the Qur’an may be lost. Therefore I suggest, you (Abu Bakr) order that the Qur’an be collected.” I said to ‘Umar, “How can you do something which Allah’s Apostle did not do?” ‘Umar said, “By Allah, that is a good project. “Umar kept on urging me to accept his proposal till Allah opened my chest for it and I began to realize the good in the idea which ‘Umar had realized.” Then Abu Bakr said (to me). ‘You are a wise young man and we do not have any suspicion about you, and you used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah’s Apostle. So you should search for (the fragmentary scripts of) the Qur’an and collect it in one book).” By Allah If they had ordered me to shift one of the mountains, it would not have been heavier for me than this ordering me to collect the Qur’an. Then I said to Abu Bakr, “How will you do something which Allah’s Apostle did not do?” Abu Bakr replied, “By Allah, it is a good project.” Abu Bakr kept on urging me to accept his idea until Allah opened my chest for what He had opened the chests of Abu Bakr and ‘Umar. So I started looking for the Qur’an and collecting it from (what was written on) palmed stalks, thin white stones and also from the men who knew it by heart, till I found the last Verse of Surat At-Tauba (Repentance) with Abi Khuzaima Al-Ansari, and I did not find it with anybody other than him. The Verse is:

Hadith - Volume 2, Book 21, Number 263 : Narrated by Jabir bin ‘Abdullah
The Prophet (p.b.u.h) used to teach us the way of doing Istikhara (Istikhara means to ask Allah to guide one to the right sort of action concerning any job or a deed), in all matters as he taught us the Suras of the Quran. He said, “If anyone of you thinks of doing any job he should offer a two Rakat prayer other than the compulsory ones and say (after the prayer): – ‘Allahumma inni astakhiruka bi’ilmika, Wa astaqdiruka bi-qudratika, Wa as’alaka min fadlika al-‘azlm Fa-innaka taqdiru Wala aqdiru, Wa ta’lamu Wala a’lamu, Wa anta ‘allamu l-ghuyub. Allahumma, in kunta ta’lam anna hadha-l-amra Khairun li fi dini wa ma’ashi wa’aqibati amri (or ‘ajili amri wa’ajilihi) Faqdirhu wa yas-sirhu li thumma barik li Fihi, Wa in kunta ta’lamu anna hadha-lamra shar-run li fi dini wa ma’ashi wa’aqibati amri (or fi’ajili amri wa ajilihi) Fasrifhu anni was-rifni anhu. Waqdir li al-khaira haithu kana Thumma ardini bihi.’ (O Allah! I ask guidance from Your knowledge, And Power from Your Might and I ask for Your great blessings. You are capable and I am not. You know and I do not and You know the unseen. O Allah! If You know that this job is good for my religion and my subsistence and in my Hereafter–(or said: If it is better for my present and later needs)–Then You ordain it for me and make it easy for me to get, And then bless me in it, and if You know that this job is harmful to me In my religion and subsistence and in the Hereafter–(or said: If it is worse for my present and later needs)–Then keep it away from me and let me be away from it. And ordain for me whatever is good for me, And make me satisfied with it). The Prophet added that then the person should name (mention) his need.
