# Aslam

A personal archive for the Aslam family.

## What is this?

This is a centralised repository of knowledge, thoughts, and information for Asim Aslam and family. It exists to solve a simple problem: life accumulates information across too many places—email, docs, notes, browser bookmarks, memory—and none of it is searchable, organised, or transferable.

## Why?

- **Gmail is identity, not knowledge.** 10+ years of email is a graveyard, not a resource.
- **Shared docs are flat.** A Google Doc works for lists, but not for interconnected knowledge.
- **Memory is unreliable.** Things get forgotten. Context gets lost.
- **Continuity matters.** If I die tomorrow, what do people need to know?

## What goes here?

- **Thoughts & ideas** — things worth remembering, half-formed or complete
- **Projects** — what I'm working on, why, and where things stand
- **Assets & accounts** — passwords, credentials, important accounts (encrypted)
- **Contacts & relationships** — people, context, history
- **Documents** — important files, records, references
- **Decisions** — why certain choices were made
- **Instructions** — how to do things that only I know how to do

## Principles

1. **Searchable** — if you can't find it, it doesn't exist
2. **Structured** — tagged, categorised, linked
3. **Secure** — sensitive data encrypted at rest
4. **Simple** — easy to add, easy to retrieve
5. **Shareable** — family can access what they need
6. **Durable** — outlives any single service or platform

*A second brain, a family vault, a digital estate.*
